## Analyzing NYC High School Data
The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test given to graduating high schoolers in the US every year. The SAT has 3 sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. The SAT is used by colleges to determine which students to accept. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school. New York City has significant immigrant populations, and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to figure out the corelation between SAT score and demographic data. New York City has published data on the SAT scores of students, along with additional demographic datasets. In this project, we will analyze the New York City SAT data and figure out a corelation between SAT score and demographic data. 

The codes are written in the Jupyter notebook **'analyzing_nyc_school_data.ipynb'**. Please refer to this file.
